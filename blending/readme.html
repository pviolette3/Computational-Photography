    <h1> Assignment 5: Blending </h1>
    <div id="introduction">
        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline"> Introduction </h2>
        <p> In this homework assignment, we will be putting together a pyramid blending pipeline that will allow us to turn the following three images into a blended image (This assignment will require you to create a blend using your own images!). This assignment is completely INDIVIDUAL. You may ask others for help, but you may NOT use other people's code outside of the code we have provided to you. For the exception of simple scipy + numpy + cv2 functions, you must write the six functions we request below yourself, wrapping functions from the available libraries will not get you any credit. </p>
        <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
            <img style="" src="http://www.dcastro.me/cs4475/summer2013/assignment5/images/figure1.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <p> This is the output of blending the above two images with the mask. </p>
            <img src="http://www.dcastro.me/cs4475/summer2013/assignment5/images/output.jpg" />  
        </div>
        <p> Before we get started, <a href="http://www.dcastro.me/cs4475/summer2013/assignment5/files.zip">download this zip file</a> that contains the files you will be working with. </p>
        <p> Once you have extracted the file above, you are ready to get started. </p>
        <p> Above you can see the sample images which are provided for you in the images/source/sample directory. Every time you run the code, it will look inside each folder under images/, and attempt to find images with filenames that contain 'white', 'black' and 'mask'. Once it finds a folder that contains three images with those respective names, it will apply a blending procedure to them, and save the output to images/output/. Along with the output image, it will create visualizations of the gaussian and laplacian pyramids used in the process. </p>
        <p> The blending procedure takes two images and the mask and splits them into their red, green, and blue channels. It then blends each channel separately. </p>
        <p> As discussed in lecture, the code will construct a laplacian pyramid for the two images. It will then scale the mask image to the range [0,1] and construct a Gaussian pyramid for it. Finally, it will blend the two pyramids and collapse them to the output image. </p>
        <p> Pixel values of 255 in the mask image are scaled to the value 1 in the mask pyramid, and assigned the strongest weight to the image labeled 'white' during blending. Pixel values of 0 in the mask image are scaled to the value 0 in the mask pyramid, and assigned the strongest weight to the image labeled 'black' during blending. </p>
        <p> In order to facilitate this process, you will be providing six (6) key functions throughout this programming assignment. First, you will implement the reduce and expand functions in <strong>part0.py.</strong>. Then, you will write code to construct Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids using these functions in <strong> part1.py </strong>. Finally, you will write code that blends two Laplacian pyramids using a mask, and collapses a Laplacian pyramid into an output image in <strong> part2.py </strong>.</p>
        <p> This assignment should take you approximately 6 hours. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="part0">
        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline"> Part 0: Reduce and Expand functions. </h2>
        <p> <strong> See Tutorial 4 - 9 under Module 4 for a more in depth explanation of Reduce and Expand. </strong> </p>
        <p> As with previous assignments, running <strong> part0.py </strong> directly will apply a unit test to your code and print out helpful feedback. You can use this to debug your functions.</p>
        <h3 style="color: black;"> reduce </h3>
        <p> This function is defined in the part0.py file. The lecture and tutorial videos, and the documentation string in the file will give you more detail about what it should do. </p>
        <p> As seen in the lectures and tutorial videos, this function takes an image, smooths it, and then subsamples it down to a quarter of the size (dividing the height and width by two). </p>
        <p> Within the code, you are provided with a generating_kernel(a) function. This function takes a floating point number a, and returns a 5x5 generating kernel. For the reduce and expand functions, you should use a=0.4. </p>
        <p> Seeing as we have already covered how convolve works in class, for this assignment we allow you to use the library implementation of convolve. </p>
        <p style="width: 100%; height: 80px; background-color: #DDD; border: 1px solid #222; padding: 5px;">
            import scipy.signal<br>
            scipy.signal.convolve2d(image, kernel, 'same')
        </p>
        <p> This call will convolve the image and kernel, and return an array of the 'same' size as image.</p>

        <h3 style="color: black;"> expand </h3>
        <p> This function is defined in the <strong> part0.py </strong> file. The lecture and tutorial videos from the Dropbox folder will give you more details about what it should do. </p>
        <p> As seen in the lectures and tutorial video, this function takes an image and supersamples it to four times the size (multiplying the height and width by two (2)). After increasing the size, we have to interpolate the missing values by running over it with a smoothing filter. </p>
        <p> For this part of the assignment, please use the generating kernel with a=0.4 and the convolve2d function from the reduce function discussion above. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="part1">
        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline"> Part 1: Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids </h2>
        <p> In this part of hte assignment, you will be implementing functions that create Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids. As usual, use <strong> part1.py </strong> to test your code. In addition, run.py defines the functions viz_gauss_pyramid and viz_lapl_pyramid, which take a pyramid as input and return an image visualizaiton. You might want to use these functions to visualize your pyramids while debugging. </p>
        <h3 style="color: black;"> gauss_pyramid </h3>
        <p> This function is defined in the part1.py file. The lecture and tutorial vidoes in the dropbox folder, and the documentation string in the file will give you more detail about what it should do.</p>
        <p> This function takes an image and builds a pyramid out of it. The first layer of this pyramid is the original image, and each subsequent layer of the pyramid is the reduced form of the previous layer. Put simply, you are iteratively calling the reduce function on the output of the previous call, with the first call simply being the input image. </p>
        <p> Within the code, these pyramids are represented as lists of arrays, so: </p>
        <p style="width: 100%; height: 80px; background-color: #DDD; border: 1px solid #222; padding: 5px;">
            pyramid = [layer0, layer1, layer2, ...]<br>
            layer0 = np.array(shape, dtype=float)
        </p>
        <p> Please use the reduce function that you implemented in the previous part in order to write this function. </p>
        <h3 style="color: black;"> lapl_pyramid </h3>
        <p> This function is defined in the <strong> part1.py </strong> file. The lecture and tutorial videos, and the documentation string in the file will give you more detail about what it should do. </p>
        <p> This function takes a Gaussian pyramid constructed by the previous function, and turns it into a Laplacian pyramid. The doc string contains further information about the operations you should perform for each layer. </p>
        <p> Like with Gaussian pyramids, Laplacian pyramids are represented as lists of numpy arrays in the code. </p>
        <p> Please use the expand function that you implemented in the previous part of the code in order to write this function. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="part2">
        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline"> Part 2: Writing the blend and collapse functions. </h2>
        <p> In this part, you will be completing the pipeline by writing the actual blend function, and creating a collapse function that will allow us to convert our Laplacian pyramid into an output image. </p>
        <p> As always, you can use <strong> part2.py </strong> to test your code. </p>
        <h3 style="color: black;"> blend </h3>
        <p> This function is defined in the <strong> part2.py</strong> file. The lecture and documentation string in the file will give you more detail about what it should do. </p>
        <p> This function takes three pyramids: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> white - a laplacian pyramid of an image </li>
            <li> black - a laplacian pyramid of another imge. </li>
            <li> mask - a gaussian pyramid of a mask image. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> It should perform an alpha-blend of the two Laplacian pyramids according to the mask pyramid. So you will be blending each pair of layers together using the mask of that layer as the weight. </p>
        <p> As described in the doc string, pixels where the mask is 1 should be taken from the white image, pixels where the mask is 0 should be taken from the black image. Pixels with value 0.5 in the mask should be an equal blend of the white and black images, etc. </p>
        <p> You may assume that all of the provided pyramids are of the same dimensons, and have dtype float. You may furhter assume that the mask pyramid has values in the range [0,1]. </p>
        <p> Your output pyramid should be of the same dimensions as all the inputs, and dtype float. </p>
        <h3 style="color: black;"> collapse </h3>
        <p> This function is defined in the part2.py file. The documentation string will give you more detail about what it should do. </p>
        <p> This function is given a laplacian pyramid and is expected to 'flatten' it to an image. </p>
        <p> We need to take the top layer, expand it, and then add it to the next layer. The results in a pyramid of one level less than we started with. We continue this process until we are left with only a single layer. </p>
        <p> This function should return a numpy array of the same shape as the base layer of the pyramid, and dtype float. </p>

        <h2 style="color: black; font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline"> What to turn in (this time points will be deducted if you do not follow this to the letter): </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> LastName_FI_A5.zip (so for me (Daniel Castro), that'd be Castro_D_A5.zip This file should contain a folder titled LastName_FI_A5, this folder should contain 4 files, and an images folder with your images.</li>

                <li> <strong>part2.py</strong> - Your code for part 2. </li>
                <li> <strong>Analysis.pdf</strong> - should include a short paragraph explaining what you did, who helped you, your sources, and anything else you think is relevant. Keep it succint. Also, if Irfan or I (Daniel) helped you, you don't have to mention it since we're grading you. </li>
                <li> <strong>LastName_FI_output.jpg</strong> - your blended output image. Please DO NOT use the example images we provide. Use your own, and if you are using images you find online, make sure you have permission, and cite them accordingly in the PDF. </li>
